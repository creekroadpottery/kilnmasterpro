**Solution:** Start with 50°F offset for brand new elements, then reduce as they break in

## 🏺 The Story Behind KilnMaster Pro

This project was inspired by **Alford Wayman** at **Creek Road Pottery LLC**, who shared insights about the universal challenges potters face with kiln management and helped identify the need for better firing documentation tools.

Though Alford works primarily with gas kilns, his observations about the pottery community's struggles with inconsistent firings, lost records, and maintenance tracking highlighted problems that span all kiln types. His humble suggestion that "maybe an app could help" sparked the creation of this comprehensive solution for electric kiln management.

> *"The idea came from real pottery studio frustrations - watching fellow ceramicists struggle with the same offset guesswork and lost firing data that we all face."* - Alford Wayman, Creek Road Pottery LLC
